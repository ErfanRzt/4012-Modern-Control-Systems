# Capstone: Modern Control Design and Analysis
The capstone project for the Modern Control course at Iran University of Science and Technology involved designing control systems for an assumed dynamic system. The project consisted of several tasks, including designing state feedback and tracking controllers, full-order and reduced-order observers, and optimizing the state feedback gain for a given cost function.

Control systems are essential for regulating or tracking the behavior of a dynamic system by manipulating its inputs or states. To achieve the desired performance objectives, such as stability, tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness, appropriate feedback laws must be selected.

In this project, students applied different control design techniques to an assumed dynamic system and then analyzed and compared the performance of the resulting control systems. By doing so, they gained hands-on experience in designing and analyzing control systems, a crucial skill in the field of engineering, particularly in areas such as robotics, aerospace, and manufacturing.

Here, I will be sharing my implementation of the project, which involves designing and analyzing control using modern control techniques. Additionally, to analyze the various control design techniques, I used MATLAB and Simulink. These tools allowed me to compare and simulate different approaches, and to visualize the performance of the resulting control systems. In this repository, you will find all the MATLAB and Simulink codes and documentation related to the project.
